The Zem Organization Medical Website is a web application built using C# Razor Pages, ASP.NET Core, authentication, and authorization. 
The platform is designed to help users view and join medical workshops and it has an admin dashboard so that they can update/delete/add new workshops. 
The application also includes essential pages like Home, Contact, and About Us to inform visitors about the organization's mission and services.
It's modeled after the first Zem website: https://zem.ssmb.ro/.
